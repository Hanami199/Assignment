Tasks are decomposed in a grid 1 x 1

Task    0: 	grid coordinates :   0,   0
	neighbours: N   -2    E   -2    S   -2    W   -2
My (rank 0) patch size is 10000 x 10000
Rank 0 signals initialization completed. Beginning computation part.
Total execution time for rank 0: 16.402189
Average comm waiting time and copy time (averaged across 1 ranks):
 wait=0.000002s
copy=0.000000s
total injected energy is 4000, system energy is 4000 ( in avg 4e-05 per grid point)
